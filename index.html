    <h1>Learning The Basics</h1>
    <div>
      <h3>The Web and Accessing it</h3>
      <p>
      A lot of things are happening in the background when you do something as simple as accessing a
      <b>Web Page</b>.
      When you go to your favourite website using your browser, it uses a language called <b>HTML</b>
      ,which stands for <em>Hyper Text Mark Up Language</em>, that tells your browser how to display contant and what happens
      when the user interacts with it.<br>
      When you type an address into your browser, your computer is essentially fetching files from a server half way across the world
      for your viewing pleasure. But how does it do this? Using <b>HTTP</b>, <em>Hypertext Tranfer Protocal</em>, a protocal used to communicate with servers.
      </p>

      <h3>HTML Structure</h3>
      <p>
      I like to think of <b>HTML</b> like the Human body; It has an element on top that defines what type it is (<em>DOCTYPE</em>),
      a <b>head</b> with a name and a brain that contains <em>Metadata</em> defining how it should communicate with you (<em>Title, CSS, JS</em>), 
      and <b>body</b> that has all the contant you want to consume (<em>Images, videos, text</em>). It looks a little like this:<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      DOCTYPE--->defines it as HTML<br>Head--->Contains the name of the page and other Data linking to CSS and JS<br>
      Body--->That contant you are here for!
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>All About the Elements!</h3>
      <p>
      Elements contains <b>Tags</b> that tell your browser how it should display contant. These are used to display links, images, and format contant to look a certain way.
      So far, we know that there are two type of elements in <b>HTML</b>; <em>inline</em> and <em>block</em> elements.<br>
      Inline elements will display contant on the same line. However, block elements will create an invisable box around contant giving it a block of its own (just like how this page is 
      <em>divided</em> into seperate section using the <b>DIV</b> block element). Below is an example of using <em>inline</em> elements with links and pictures.
      <br>
      <h4>Inline elements example:</h4>
      <p> 
      One of my favourite hobbies is playing <em>music</em>. My favourite instrument is the <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar">Guitar</a>, specifically,
      my telecaster that looks kinda like this
